# Proxy - WIP ~50% done
Fast and easy anonymous chat for iOS.

## Notable features
- `DB.swift` and other `DB*` files: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) wrapper
- `AsyncWorkGroupKey.swift`: clean and easy way to wait on multiple async requests to complete
- Heavily protocol oriented
- Clean view controllers, nearly all logic abstracted away
  - Lots going on but all under 50 lines of code
