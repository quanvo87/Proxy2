Create unlimited, randomized, anonymous user names (Proxy's) with just one tap. Talk to any other Proxy. Delete your Proxy when you're done. Never share your phone number or email with strangers again.

- `DB.swift` and other `DB*` files: [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) wrapper
- `AsyncWorkGroupKey.swift`: clean and easy way to wait on multiple async requests to complete
- Heavily protocol oriented
- Clean view controllers, nearly all logic abstracted away
  - Lots going on but most under 50 lines of code
